### ==========Iteration 4 Additional Methods Descriptions==========

#### `sales_analyst.most_sold_item_for_merchant(merchant_id)`

This method acts on the instance of `sales_analyst`. It takes in `merchant_id`
as its argument and returns an array of the most sold `items` by the `merchant`.

The method searches for all `items` in `invoice_items` that has a matching `merchant_id`
`&&` a corresponding successful transaction status.

`items` are returned as an array.  The number of occurrences of an `item` is documented as the `value` and the `item` as the `key` in a `hash`. The `hash` is sorted by the number of `occurrences` to return the `item` with the highest number of `occurrences`.  

If there is a tie multiple `items` will be returned as an array.


#### `sales_analyst.best_item_for_merchant(merchant_id)`

This method acts on the instance of `sales_analyst`. It takes in `merchant_id`
as its argument and returns an array of the most sold `items` by the `merchant`.

The method searches for all `items` in `invoice_items` that has a matching `merchant_id` `&&` a corresponding successful transaction status. The overall revenue generated by the `item` is calculated by summing product of the `quantity` and the `unit_price` in all successful `transactions`.


The overall revenue of an `item` is documented as the `value` and the `item` as the `key` in a `hash`. The `hash` is sorted by the overall revenue to return the `item` with the largest overall revenue.

If there happens to be a tie, multiple `items` will be returned as an array.
